    This build file can build all the VUE sources, as well as package
    them into various jar files useful for testing or test
    distribution.  This including a Mac Finder or Windows Explorer
    double-clickable (runnable) jar file that inclues all required
    third party libraries (if java has already been installed on the
    system).  Or it can be run from the command line with:
    
        java -jar VUE.jar
    
    Note that this is really only useful for testing, as it still
    doesn't let us set a VUE icon for the file, or install a JVM if
    one isn't present.  The targets for creating VUE-lib.jar and
    VUE-core.jar are for convenience.  The VUE-lib.jar portion is huge
    and slow to create, whereas VUE-core.jar is just the VUE classes
    and resources, and is quick to create.  This is convenient for
    frequently moving around just VUE-core.jar and running via:

        java -cp VUE-core.jar:VUE-lib.jar tufts.vue.VUE

    Mac Version: a Mac OS X Application directory can be build with
    the mac-dist target. It uses template info in the MacOS directory
    to create build/VUE.app, and then copy the current VUE.jar there,
    at which point it's ready to go as a Mac OS X app.  Just drop the folder
    into /Applications (or wherever you like), double-click it and
    you're off and running.
